# Tetris written in SDL2 and C++

## TODO

- Add Gamemodes
  - Gamemode selection screen
- Save score
  - Think of a better scoring system
  - Save to a file
- Maybe Multiplayer
  - Select 1 Player/2 Player in the title
  - Peer2Peer or server based?
    - Server based could also cloud save the savegame
- Cleanup code/Refractor
- Comment/Document stuff
